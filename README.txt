Mathematica code to illustrate the basic concepts of
crystal structures and axial and mirror symmetry.

Source functions are in crystal.wl, and demos are in
crystal structure demo.nb.

Created 2015 by Leanne Friedrich for a feminist science 
humor blog that I never followed through on, 
which is why one of the demo asymmetric structures is a pot.
